TODO: document more about how to use things


Frontend
-----
- We are using Yarn, Facebook's proprietary package managing tool. We are using it in place of NPM because it has better support for versionining and dependency control.
- DO NOT NPM INSTALL!!!
- `yarn install`: installs all dependencies in the `package.json` file
- `yarn add <package-name>`: installs the given package and adds it to the yarn.lock file
- `yarn list`: lists all of the installed packages
- `yarn remove <package-name>`: removes the package from your node_modules and also your yarn.lock file.
- Documentation: (https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/cli/)
